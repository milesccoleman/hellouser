# hellouser

A super simple Vue app!

Live version of app: http://milesccoleman.com/hellouser/Â 

In order to run the app, you'll need to install `node` and `npm`. A useful tutorial exists here: http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac

Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory, and use `npm` to install `vue`. 
  
    `npm install vue`
    
Using `vue` installed you can now use `webpack` to bundle the modules of the app. 

    `npm install webpack`
