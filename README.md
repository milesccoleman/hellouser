In order to run the app, you'll need to install `node` and `npm`. A useful tutorial exists here: http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac

You will also need to install `webpack`. Tutorial here: https://webpack.js.org/guides/installation/

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory. 
    `npm install vue`
2. Use `npm` to install `vue`. 
    `npm install vue`
Using `vue` installed you can now use `webpack` to bundle the modules of the app. 
    `npm install webpack`
